# Pet Prints
Software for my photogrammetry booth build, written in early 2018. Read more on my blog at https://matthewbell.dev/blog/building-pet-scanning-booth.

At the time I wrote this I didn't use a virtual environment (Read: didn't know how)... So, unfortunately it might be a bit of a pain if you actually want to run this code.

But at least it's here to look at if you're curious.
